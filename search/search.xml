Surprisingly, it’s in the present, in our mind.<br>What does it mean “to see the future”? The events are never what we had expected.</p><p>We can talk about the future only in the terms of “possible” (of what may happen or may not happen).</p><p>What is <strong>planning</strong>? It’s the seeing of steps from the point A to the point B, where point B is the <strong>goal</strong>.<br>When we make one step further towards the future, our vision of the future changes.</p><p>Personal strategy – <strong>understanding</strong> of one’s role and position in the event flow of the future,<br>which allows to plan actions to meet the goal.</p>]]></content>
